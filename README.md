# Whatsapp Chat Scraper
I built this scraper to scrape the messages sent in a WhatsApp chat between a friend and I, for the purpose of building a ML model that could predict who was more likely to say what, and maybe even predict our next messages.
Unfortunately I never got around to building the ML model, and it ended up uncompleted like the rest of my projects.
Hopefully someday I'll get around to finishing this.
More details:
It runs on puppeteer and nodejs, and has the ability to split the messages scraped into a training and test dataset.
It also has the option to preserve all data or remove data accordingly so that the messages in the dataset sent by both parties are at an equal number.
Commands are issued to it through the console.
If future needs call for it, it is designed in such a way that its functions can be easily expanded.
